## The Fruta Assignment

Your task is to build out some features for this application by integrating and utilizing the [fruits-api](http://localhost:9000/graphql), a [graphql](https://graphql.org/learn/) api.

Be sure to have it running: `yarn fruits:api`

---

**Please bear in mind the following when completing this task**:
1. Be mindful about adding any further 3rd party dependencies to the project. Adding a
    complex library or framework could easily use up all the time you have available to
    work on this and don’t give much insight into your ability.

2. We have deliberately not included any designs/wireframes. Use your flair for UX to
    come up with something simple, clean, and functional, that compliments the projects overall theme.

3. The project should be cloned from this one and submitted as a zip file.
   * Include a readme with the answers to the below questions, any notes you would like us to have, any feedback on the assignment itself, and list anything in the assignment you were not able to cover.
  
4. Please timebox your time on this homework to between 3 to 5 hours (i.e. one or two
evenings). Think carefully about how you’ll use the time. It isn’t necessary to provide a complete solution, but we do want to see an aspect of it working end to end. Also please for the code you do complete, please deliver it as you would working code headed to a production environment.

*Along with submitting the code you write, please also answer the following questions:*

1. What changes would you ask for from the backend API developers to enable you to improve the experience for the user and ensure Fruta is scalable in terms of fruit count.
2. What considerations should we make specifically related to internationalisation and accessibility of the platform?

## The Fruta Assignment

Your task is to build out some features for this application by integrating and utilizing the [fruits-api](https://fruits-api.netlify.app/graphql), a graphql api.

---

**Please bear in mind the following when completing this task**:
1. You should utilize the components provided in the lib-fruta package when possible
  
2. Be mindful about adding any further 3rd party dependencies to the project. Adding a
    complex library or framework could easily use up all the time you have available to
    work on this and don’t give much insight into your ability.

3. We have deliberately not included any wireframes. Please use your flair for UX to
    come up with something simple, clean and functional.

4. The project should be branched off of this one and finally submitted as a pull request with a detailed description

5. You should let us know which requirements, if any, you were not able to cover.
  
6. Please timebox your time on this homework to between 3 to 5 hours (i.e. one or two
evenings). Think carefully about how you’ll use the time. It isn’t necessary to provide a complete solution, but we do want to see an aspect of it working end to end. Also please for the code you do complete, please deliver it as you would working code headed to a production environment.

*Along with submitting the code you write, please also answer the following questions:*

1. What changes would you ask for from the backend API developers to enable you to
ensure Lantern is scalable in terms of device count.
2. What considerations should we make specifically related to internationalisation of the
platform?
